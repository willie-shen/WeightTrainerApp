For Workout, Scene controller:

First gives a list of body

        -This will bring you to another table view, which shows what workouts you are doing
            -Option to Add, Remove, And Done
                -For added workouts, move to next table view controller, which displays sets of workouts
                    -Allows user to add set in this view controller
                        -WEight and Reps

            -Done returns to main screen of lists (As for now)



As for now, we won't have editing features. Only allowing deletes and redo

Model:

Workout
Date
Set Number
Weight

-History shows date and next pages pretty much show the same thing as the workout
    -Next Table View Shows the workouts you did on that date
        -Click on the workout, and you are taken to another table view controller, which will show all the sets

As for now, don't plan on having share feature for the workout history or workout. At this point, dont feel like there's a need to brag

Might need a data structure to store the dates you worked out on




Greedy Algorithm Idea:
    We want to choose the workout that has the longest since you worked on that exercise
        -Initialize each one first to a very high Int value
        -Each time you work that part out, you set worked out date to that date

        -When you work out, it finds the workout that has the lowest number
        -Or if you have multiple values with the same number, choose one randomly
